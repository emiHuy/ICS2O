    <h1> Genshin Impact </h1>
    <p> The most recent game I've been getting into is Genshin Impact. It is an open-world action role-playing game. At first, I thought it was going to be a horrible game, however, when I started to play it, I was amazed. Below are some of the great things Genshin Impact has to offer.</p>

    <h2> Story </h2> 
    
    <img class=traveler src= "travelers.png" alt= "two twin travelers">
    
    <p> One of the main things that I like about this game is the story. There is the main story and then there are side stories or side quests. <br> <br>
      The main story is about two twin travelers who become trapped on a world called Teyvat. They become separated and lose their powers. The main character, also known as the Traveler, is on their journey through the seven nations of Teyvat to find their long lost twin, and to find the truth of this world. <br> </p>

    <h2> Characters </h2>
    
    <img src= "raiden-shogun.png" alt= "Raiden Shogun character">
    
    <p> As the traveler travels across the nations of Teyvat, they meet other amazing characters. Each and every character has their own unique design, voice, gameplay, animations, music, and story that we get to learn about. Characters are often the hype of Genshin Impact, and are obtainable and playable. </p>

    <h2> Cutscenes </h2>
    <p> During stories and quests, there are amzing animated cutscenes that give the players a whole new experience. Cutscenes can vary from epic combat scenes to a nice traditional opera scene. The cutscenes are so amazing and mesmorizing that I always find myself going back to watch them again on Youtube. </p> 
    
      
    <h2> Graphics </h2>

    <p>For a free game that can be played on multiple devices such as PC and mobile, the graphics are fantastic. While exploring and traveling the world of Teyvat, we can see the beautiful views of the nations and landscapes. </p>

    <h2> Music </h2>
    <p> Instrumental music is a large part of Genshin Impact. Music is always played when playing the game, and in quests, cutscenes, battle scenes, character trailers, and update trailers. Genshin Impact contains some fantastic soundtracks that are great to listen to. 
    
    <h2> Co-op </h2>
    <p> Co-op is an in-game function that allows users to join their friends' worlds or join other users playing the game. There can be a maximum of 4 players in one world. Co-op also allows you to play fun event games with others such as Windtrace, which is similar to a game of hide and seek. </p>
