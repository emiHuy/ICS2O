    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> Animal Crossing is a video game series published by Nintendo. This video game is a more casual, relaxing, wholesome, and open-ended game as players are able to do as they like. Players are able to build and decorate their town and house, interact with villagers, and do other activities such as fishing. </p>
    
    <h2> Playing with Friends </h2>
    <p> In Animal Crossing, you can also invite friends over to your town. This way, you can play with friends, show off your town, and have a fun time together! </p>

    <h2> Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h2>

    <p> The latest version of Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, on the Nintendo Switch, offers even more to players. The graphics are much better, the game allows more creativity and customization in your town, and there are more villager interactions! I hope to be able to play this version of the game in the future.</p>
